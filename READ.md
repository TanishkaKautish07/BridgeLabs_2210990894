The Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are two essential components for working with Java. The JRE is responsible for running Java applications; it contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the core libraries needed to execute Java bytecode. However, it doesn’t include development tools like a compiler. That’s where the JDK comes in—it includes the JRE along with tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities necessary for writing and building Java programs. When you write code in Java, the compiler (javac) translates the .java source files into .class files containing bytecode. This bytecode is platform-independent and is executed by the JVM, which acts as an interpreter, reading and executing each line of bytecode during runtime. So, the compiler handles translation during development, while the interpreter ensures the program runs as expected on any machine with a JVM. This dual-stage process is a key reason Java is considered both compiled and interpreted.

We started with git and gitHUb and did all commands like nano,cat,echo,touch,add,push,commit,did all the basix revisions of git and git Hub

we discussed about Boxing and Unboxing in java which is automatic conversions between primitive datatypes and their corresponding wrapper classes, and then we discussed about the sizes of the datatypes and their types. We also created new branch on the github repo with command, git branch Features and then we pushed our branch, git push -u origin Features and then we checked what all branches we have with command,git branch. we added anew file called text1 in features branch. Then we created more branches in main.

/* CLASS NAME ALWAYS STARTS WITH CAPITAL LETTERS */

public class MyClass {

  int b; //this var is inside class, so this is instance variable
    static int s; //this can be accessed anywhere inside the class.
    //code in another file
}


command to check that the git repo is connected to the main folder or not,

 (git remote -v)
TYPES OF VARIABLE ARE :

1) LOCAL  : THEY ARE ACCESSED INSIDE THE METHODS ONLY ; Local variables must be initialized before they can be used
2) INSTANCE : THEY AREACCESSED INSIDE THE CLASS ONLY ; Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.
3) STATIC  : Static variables are accessed through the class they belong to, they are declared using the static keyword.
